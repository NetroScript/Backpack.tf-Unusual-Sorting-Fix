# Temporary Backpack.tf Fix
Fixes the order of Unusuals at https://backpack.tf/unusual/<unusual> and https://backpack.tf/unusuals/.
Additionally you can sort by other values (including price, number in existance, name, effect-id) and the filter input field is fixed.


## Installation
Use an extension which can execute userscripts (F.e. [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)  for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox))
and then install using this link: [Temporary Backpack.tf Fix.user.js](https://github.com/NetroScript/Backpack.tf-Unusual-Sorting-Fix/raw/master/Temporary%20Backpack.tf%20Fix.user.js).

(Or paste / install it manually for your plugin)
